# i18n SubModule

This module adds i18n support for your Rising World scripts.


## Installation

This script is not standalone and must be used with your own script, as it doesn't have a `definition.xml` file.


### Direct installation (not recommended)

You only need to copy the file `i18n.lua` to your script's directory. Whenever the file needs updating, this manual step must be done. This is a non-desirable method as, if commited, it will create duplicate versions of this file across different repositories.


### Using as a Git Sub-Module (recommended)

At the script base folder, execute the two commands

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/RisingWorld/i18n
$ git commit -am 'Added i18n sub-module'
```

This will create a directory called `i18n`, and clone this repository in it. However, the content of the directory will not be commited with the rest of your project, only the directory entry and a file called `.gitmodules` 

Whenever the project needs updating, perform this command, also at the script's base folder :

```
$ git submodule update --remote i18n
```

Refer to the [official Git documentation](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more information.


## Usage

The best way to initialize localization for your scripts is to, first, create an `lc_messages` directory. Your project should look like this

```
./awesome-script
  ./lc_messages
    ./de.locale
    ./en.locale
    ./fr.locale
  ./i18n
    ./i18n.lua
  ./config.properties
  ./definition.xml
  ./awesome.lua
```

The content of your configuration file should have a configuration such as

```
# Default locale. By default, i18n will use "en"
i18n.defaultLocale=fr

# Available locales, what files to load in lc_messages/*.locale
i18n.availableLocales=de,en,fr
```

Then, in your `awesome.lua` script, initialize it like this

```
include("i18n/i18n.lua");

function onEnable()
  local config = getProperty("config.properties");

  i18n.init(config);

  -- localization should already be available!
  print(i18n.t(nil, "script.ready", "0.0.1"));
end
```

**Note**: we did not specify a player, here, therefore the default locale will be used (i.e. `"fr"`)

The `.locale` files are simply properties. They are using the `.locale` extention as a convention and for semantics.

Each localized strings are sent through the `string.format` function. Therefore, the locale files may look like this :

```
# en.locale
script.ready=Script v%s ready!
```

```
# fr.locale
script.ready=Script v%s prÃªt!
```

```
# de.locale
script.ready=Skript v0.1 fertig!
```

**IMPORTANT!** All locale files declared via the `i18n.availableLocales` config property must exist! They may, however, be empty, or missing some properties.


## API Reference

* `i18n.init(config)`
  Initialize the localization module using the given config properties.
* `i18n.t(player, msg, ...)`
  Translate `msg` into the `player`'s language, or into the default language otherwise (ex: if `player == nil` or no other suitable locale was found). If the value cannot be translated anyway, it is formatted and
  returned as is. Returns a `string`.
